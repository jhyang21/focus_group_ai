Q: What are your initial thoughts or perceptions when you hear about Emory University and its students?
A: When I hear about Emory University, the first thing that pops into my mind is just how privileged and lucky the students must be. Like, seriously, they must have it all handed to them – fancy dorms, endless resources, you name it. It's kind of like they live in a different world where everything is perfect and easy.

Q: How would you describe the academic environment at Emory University based on what you know or have experienced?
A: From what I've heard, Emory's academic environment is super competitive and challenging, but almost exclusively accessible to those who already have a head start. It's like playing a game on easy mode if you already belong to the right circles or have the financial backing.

Q: What characteristics do you associate with Emory University students, both academically and socially?
A: I imagine Emory students as being really driven and probably quite smart academically, but socially, they might be a bit entitled. They have access to so many opportunities that not everyone gets, so it seems like they might take some things for granted that others have to struggle to achieve.

Q: Have you had any personal experiences with Emory students, and how have those experiences shaped your opinion of them?
A: I've met a couple of Emory students at community events, and honestly, they seemed nice, but there was definitely a sense of them being a bit out of touch with reality. They talked about trips abroad and internships like it was the norm for everyone, which really shaped my opinion on how unaware they might be of their privileges.

Q: In what ways do you think Emory University students differ from those at other universities, particularly within the region?
A: Emory students, I think, would stand out from students at other regional universities by their resources and networks. While other universities have their strengths, Emory seems to attract those who have a clear path to success laid out, whereas students at other institutions might be a bit more diverse in terms of backgrounds and experiences.

Q: What do you think are the strengths and weaknesses of Emory University students in comparison to students from other institutions?
A: The strengths of Emory students would probably be their academic rigor and networking opportunities. As for weaknesses, maybe they lack a certain resilience or ability to navigate challenges that aren't handed to them on a silver platter, unlike students from more diverse backgrounds who have to fight their way through.

Q: How do your perceptions of Emory students align with or differ from what you hear in the media or from others?
A: My perceptions sometimes clash with the media portrayal, which often highlights their achievements and campus lifestyle as something everyone should aspire to. From what I've seen, it doesn't reflect the reality of most people's college experiences, especially those from less affluent backgrounds.

Q: If you had to summarize your overall view of Emory University students in a few words or a short statement, what would it be?
A: Emory University students seem sheltered and privileged, yet undeniably ambitious and resourceful—like they're ready to conquer the world, but might not fully understand it.
