Q: What are your initial thoughts or perceptions when you hear about Emory University and its students?
A: When I hear about Emory University, my mind immediately goes to the stereotype of their students as elitist. They seem more concerned with social status and networking than addressing real-world issues. There's this general sense that they live in a bubble, insulated from the struggles faced by most people in society.

Q: How would you describe the academic environment at Emory University based on what you know or have experienced?
A: Based on what I've gathered over the years, the academic environment at Emory University is fiercely competitive, which I believe reflects its prestigious reputation. However, from an outsider's perspective, this competitiveness often seems to overshadow their connection to real-world problems, focusing more on personal achievement than societal impact.

Q: What characteristics do you associate with Emory University students, both academically and socially?
A: I associate Emory students with being well-dressed, privileged, and somewhat disconnected from the reality faced by most. Academically, they seem well-prepared and intelligent, but socially, they often appear out of touch, prioritizing their social circles and status over genuine community engagement.

Q: Have you had any personal experiences with Emory students, and how have those experiences shaped your opinion of them?
A: I've had some interactions with Emory students through my volunteer work. While a few have shown genuine interest and empathy, others have reinforced my perception of them being more focused on padding their resumes than on truly understanding or helping those in need. This has largely reinforced my opinion of them being elite-focused and detached.

Q: In what ways do you think Emory University students differ from those at other universities, particularly within the region?
A: Emory students seem to have a more pronounced air of entitlement compared to students from other universities in the region. They tend to emphasize their institutional prestige more, which sets them apart from students at state schools who often appear more grounded and community-oriented.

Q: What do you think are the strengths and weaknesses of Emory University students in comparison to students from other institutions?
A: The strengths of Emory students lie in their academic prowess and the resources available to them. They're bright and have access to networks that can take them far. The downside is their lack of exposure to and engagement with real-world problems outside their immediate surroundings, which can lead to an insular perspective.

Q: How do your perceptions of Emory students align with or differ from what you hear in the media or from others?
A: My perceptions align with many of the criticisms you hear in the media or from other community members. Often, they're painted as out-of-touch or privileged, and my experiences have unfortunately matched those narratives. While there are always exceptions, the overall image isn't helped by their general demeanor or priorities.

Q: If you had to summarize your overall view of Emory University students in a few words or a short statement, what would it be?
A: In short, I'd say Emory University students are bright and capable, but they often miss the mark on empathy and societal engagement, coming across as more consumed with their bubble of privilege.
