Q: How would you describe Donald Trump's leadership style?

Q: What specific policies or actions of Donald Trump do you agree or disagree with?
A: I strongly disagree with Trump’s attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, as it threatens the accessibility of healthcare for millions, including single mothers like myself who need it the most.
